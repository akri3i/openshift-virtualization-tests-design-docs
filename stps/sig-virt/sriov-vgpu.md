  - GA: v5.2.0
- **QE Owner(s):** Akriti Gupta (@akri3i)
- **Owning SIG:** sig-virt
- **Participating SIGs:** sig-virt

**Document Conventions:**

- **SR-IOV vGPU** — GPU virtualization that exposes NVIDIA GPU as Virtual Functions (VFs)
  to VMs for shared GPU access. On RHCOS 10 kernels, this replaces mediated-device
  (mdev) based vGPU for Ampere and newer GPUs; pre-Ampere GPUs continue to use mdev
  vGPU on RHCOS 10
- **VF** — Virtual Function: a generic SR-IOV concept where a physical device is
  partitioned into hardware-isolated slices; in this STP, the physical device is an
  NVIDIA GPU, and each VF is a slice a VM can consume for GPU acceleration
- **RHCOS10** — Red Hat CoreOS 10 worker nodes (RHEL 10 kernel), required for
  SR-IOV-based vGPU support

### **Feature Overview**

With SR-IOV vGPU support on Ampere and newer NVIDIA GPUs, customers can share a
physical GPU across multiple VMs on RHCOS10 worker nodes. Cluster administrators can
configure GPU sharing on those nodes, and VM owners can request GPU acceleration for
their workloads without dedicating an entire GPU to a single VM. Multiple VMs can each
be assigned GPU acceleration from the same physical GPU at the same time, each with
its own vGPU. Going forward, the RHEL 10 kernel only supports SR-IOV-based vGPUs for Ampere
and newer GPUs, so this is the path customers need on RHCOS10 worker nodes with that
hardware; pre-Ampere GPUs (for example Tesla T4) continue to use mdev vGPU on RHCOS10.

This STP validates SR-IOV vGPU as Tech Preview in CNV 5.0.z. A separate GA
validation plan will be added for v5.2.0.

This STP covers x86_64 only. ARM64 support is tracked separately under
[VIRTSTRAT-866](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/VIRTSTRAT-866), split out from
this feature's tracking epic, and is not covered by this STP.

### **I. Motivation and Requirements Review (QE Review Guidelines)**

This section documents the mandatory QE review process. The goal is to understand the
feature's value, technology, and testability before formal test planning.

#### **1. Requirement & User Story Review Checklist**

- [x] **Review Requirements**
  - *List the key D/S requirements reviewed:*
    - SR-IOV-based vGPUs are created and advertised for VMs on RHCOS10 worker nodes
    - VMs can request and consume an SR-IOV GPU VF
    - Multiple VMs can simultaneously use VFs from the same physical GPU. VF isolation
      is enforced by NVIDIA GPU firmware and is not independently validated by QE in
      this cycle.
    - VMs that have been assigned an SR-IOV vGPU VF detect the GPU device in the guest

- [x] **Understand Value and Customer Use Cases**
  - *Describe the feature's value to customers:* Customers running AI/ML and other
    GPU-accelerated workloads need multi-tenant GPU sharing on RHCOS10. SR-IOV vGPU
    lets multiple VMs share one physical GPU with hardware-level VF isolation, without
    dedicating a full GPU to each VM.
  - *List the customer use cases identified:*
    - As a cluster administrator, I want to configure SR-IOV vGPU devices on RHCOS10
      GPU worker nodes so multiple VMs can share a physical GPU
    - As a VM owner, I want to request a vGPU for my VM so the guest can access
      GPU acceleration

- [x] **Testability**
  - *Note any requirements that are unclear or untestable:*
    - NVIDIA GPU Operator SR-IOV vGPU support targets version 26.11 (GA target: Nov 2026)

- [x] **Acceptance Criteria**
  - *List the acceptance criteria:*
    - After SR-IOV vGPU setup on an RHCOS10 GPU worker node, the node advertises the
      expected vGPU / VF resources for VM scheduling
    - A VM requesting an SR-IOV vGPU reaches Running state and the guest detects
      GPU device
    - Two VMs sharing VFs from the same physical GPU are both Running concurrently,
      and each guest detects its assigned GPU
    - A VM with an SR-IOV vGPU can be paused and unpaused; after unpause, SSH
      connectivity to the VM is re-established within 2 minutes and the guest
      detects the GPU device again. For TP, reinitialization (device presence) is
      acceptable.
    - A VM with an SR-IOV vGPU can be restarted and the guest still detects the GPU
      after restart
    - A VM requesting an SR-IOV vGPU when no VF capacity remains stays
      Pending/unschedulable, and the scheduling event or message identifies exhausted
      SR-IOV vGPU capacity as the cause
    - On a mixed RHCOS9/RHCOS10 cluster, a VM with mdev vGPU on an RHCOS9 node and a
      VM with SR-IOV vGPU on an RHCOS10 node are both Running concurrently, and each
      guest detects its assigned GPU

- [x] **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**
  - *List applicable NFRs and their targets:*
    - **Reliability:** GPU device must be visible inside the VM after successful
      SR-IOV vGPU assignment and after restart
    - **Documentation:** Documentation is required for supported SR-IOV vGPU
      configurations
    - **Compatibility:** Feature targets RHCOS10 nodes; also validated on a mixed
      RHCOS9/RHCOS10 cluster, where RHCOS9 GPU nodes continue running mdev vGPU and
      RHCOS10 GPU nodes run SR-IOV vGPU concurrently
  - *Note any NFRs not covered and why:*
    - **Performance:** NVIDIA owns GPU
      performance characteristics. OpenShift Virtualization does not run dedicated
      GPU performance benchmarking in this cycle.
    - **Monitoring:** N/A; no new CNV alerts/metrics claimed for this cycle.
    - **Observability:** No new logs, metrics, or events are introduced by this feature.
      Existing VM status (Running/Pending) and scheduling events are sufficient to
      diagnose successful vGPU assignment and VF-capacity-exhaustion cases; validated
      via the scheduling-feedback acceptance criterion and Usability Testing.
    - **UI:** This feature introduces no OpenShift Virtualization UI changes. UI
      testing provides no customer value.
    - **Scalability:** No new scale requirements introduced; scalability is bounded by
      the maximum VFs supported by the physical GPU and the GPU Operator's scheduling
      limits, validated within standard functional boundaries.
    - **Security:** Hardware-level VF isolation is enforced by NVIDIA GPU firmware /
      SR-IOV; device exposure is provided by the NVIDIA GPU Operator. OpenShift
      Virtualization adds no new isolation mechanism here; QE validates VM consumption
      of advertised SR-IOV vGPU devices only.

#### **2. Known Limitations**

- **SR-IOV vGPU live migration is not supported**
  (tracked separately; listed as a non-requirement of the RHCOS10 epic)
  - *Sign-off:* Sudhakar Molli / 2026-09-11


#### **3. Technology and Design Review**

- [x] **Developer Handoff/QE Kickoff**
  - *Key takeaways and concerns:*
    - Ampere and newer GPUs need SR-IOV vGPU support on RHCOS10
    - SR-IOV vGPU needs NVIDIA GPU Operator version 26.11 (GA target: Nov 2026)

- [x] **Technology Challenges**
  - *List identified challenges:*
    - Requires NVIDIA SR-IOV-capable GPU hardware and RHCOS10 worker nodes
    - SR-IOV vGPU needs NVIDIA GPU Operator version 26.11
  - *Impact on testing approach:* Tests run only on RHCOS10 nodes with supported
    NVIDIA GPUs (Ampere and above) and a working GPU Operator SR-IOV vGPU configuration.

- [x] **API Extensions**
  - *List new or modified APIs:* No new user-facing APIs claimed for this STP.
  - *Testing impact:* N/A

- [x] **Test Environment Needs**
  - *See environment requirements in Section II.3 and testing tools in Section II.3.1*

- [x] **Topology Considerations**
  - *Describe topology requirements:* Bare-metal cluster with at least one RHCOS10
    worker node that has an NVIDIA SR-IOV-capable GPU, NVIDIA GPU Operator installed,
    and SR-IOV vGPU (VF) configuration applied. Also requires a mixed-cluster
    topology with at least one RHCOS9 GPU worker node configured for mdev vGPU
    alongside the RHCOS10 SR-IOV vGPU node, to validate both coexist on the same
    cluster.
  - *Impact on test design:* Multi-VM sharing scenarios require enough VFs on that
    GPU for at least two concurrent VMs. Mixed-cluster scenarios require both an
    RHCOS9 mdev-configured GPU node and an RHCOS10 SR-IOV-configured GPU node
    available at the same time.

### **II. Software Test Plan (STP)**

This STP serves as the **overall roadmap for testing**, detailing the scope, approach,
resources, and schedule.

#### **1. Scope of Testing**

**Testing Goals**

- **[P0]** As a cluster admin, after SR-IOV vGPU is configured on an RHCOS10 GPU
  worker node with an Ampere or newer NVIDIA GPU and NVIDIA GPU Operator version
  26.11 (GA target: Nov 2026), I can see the expected vGPU / VF resources advertised
  for scheduling, with capacity/allocatable reflecting the configured VF count
- **[P0]** As a VM operator, I can create a VM that requests an SR-IOV vGPU on an
  RHCOS10 worker node with an Ampere or newer NVIDIA GPU and NVIDIA GPU Operator
  version 26.11; the VM reaches Running and the guest detects a GPU device
- **[P0]** As a VM operator, when no SR-IOV vGPU capacity remains on that RHCOS10
  Ampere (or newer) node with NVIDIA GPU Operator version 26.11, a VM that requests
  a vGPU stays Pending/unschedulable, and the scheduling event or message I see
  identifies exhausted SR-IOV vGPU capacity as the cause
- **[P1]** As a cluster admin, I can run two VMs concurrently, each with an SR-IOV
  vGPU VF from the same physical Ampere or newer GPU on an RHCOS10 worker node with
  NVIDIA GPU Operator version 26.11; both reach Running and each guest detects its GPU
- **[P1]** As a VM operator, I can pause and unpause a Running VM with an SR-IOV vGPU
  on that RHCOS10 Ampere (or newer) / NVIDIA GPU Operator version 26.11 path; after
  unpause, SSH connectivity is re-established within 2 minutes and the guest detects
  the GPU device again. For TP, reinitialization (device presence) is acceptable.
- **[P1]** As a VM operator, I can restart a VM with an SR-IOV vGPU on that RHCOS10
  Ampere (or newer) / NVIDIA GPU Operator version 26.11 path; the VM returns to
  Running and the guest still detects the GPU after restart
- **[P1]** As a cluster admin, I can run a mixed RHCOS9/RHCOS10 cluster where RHCOS9
  GPU worker nodes are configured for mdev vGPU and RHCOS10 GPU worker nodes with
  Ampere or newer NVIDIA GPUs and NVIDIA GPU Operator version 26.11 run SR-IOV vGPU
  concurrently; VMs on each node type reach Running and each guest detects its
  assigned GPU
- **[P1] [Regression]** Existing GPU passthrough and pre-Ampere mdev vGPU suites
  (vGPU regression) continue to pass on supported environments,
  including pre-Ampere mdev on RHCOS10. Regression coverage is not
  listed in Section III.

**Out of Scope (Testing Scope Exclusions)**

- **Upgrade testing for SR-IOV vGPU VMs**
  - *Rationale:* This STP covers TP validation only; a separate GA validation STP
    will cover upgrade testing, including whether a VM with an SR-IOV vGPU survives
    an OCP upgrade and the guest still detects the GPU afterward, plus any VM spec
    changes required for GA
  - *PM/Lead Agreement:* Martin Tessun / 2026-09-11

- **VM continuity from RHCOS 9 to RHCOS 10 without VM spec reconfiguration**
  - *Rationale:* Explicit non-requirement of the feature epic; not in scope for
    this STP
  - *PM/Lead Agreement:* Sudhakar Molli / 2026-09-11

- **Cloud / non-bare-metal platforms**
  - *Rationale:* SR-IOV vGPU requires bare-metal NVIDIA GPU worker nodes; no dedicated
    cloud scenarios are planned
  - *PM/Lead Agreement:* Sudhakar Molli / 2026-09-11

**Test Limitations**

- **Testing blocked until NVIDIA GPU Operator SR-IOV vGPU support is available**
  (version 26.11, GA target: Nov 2026). Functional scenarios cannot
  complete without that dependency.
  - *Sign-off:* Sudhakar Molli / 2026-09-11

- **Testing is limited to available NVIDIA SR-IOV-capable GPU hardware**
  - *Sign-off:* Sudhakar Molli / 2026-09-11

#### **2. Test Strategy**

**Functional**

- [x] **Functional Testing** — Validates that the feature works according to specified
  requirements and user stories
  - *Details:* Functional tests cover RHCOS10 node vGPU/VF advertisement, VM creation
    with SR-IOV vGPU, in-guest GPU visibility, pause/unpause, restart, concurrent
    multi-VM sharing of one physical GPU, and negative scheduling when capacity is
    exhausted.

- [x] **Automation Testing** — Confirms test automation plan is in place for CI and
  regression coverage
  - *Details:* All Section III scenarios will be automated in
    OpenShift-virtualization-tests, tracked in
    [CNV-74916](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-74916) and, for the
    mixed-cluster scenario, [CNV-84169](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-84169).

- [x] **Regression Testing** — Verifies that new changes do not break existing
  functionality
  - *Details:* Per NVIDIA (not CNV): on RHCOS10, mdev vGPU remains supported for
    pre-Ampere GPUs (for example Tesla T4). Ampere and newer GPUs do not support mdev on
    RHCOS10 — they use SR-IOV vGPU instead. Existing GPU passthrough and pre-Ampere mdev
    vGPU suites remain in regression on supported environments. New SR-IOV vGPU tests are
    additive for Ampere and newer GPUs on RHCOS10.

- [ ] **Self-Validation Testing** — Should any of the new tests be included in the
  self-validation test package?
  - *Details:* N/A. SR-IOV vGPU tests require specialized GPU hardware, RHCOS10 GPU
    nodes, and NVIDIA GPU Operator SR-IOV support not available in self-validation
    environments.

**Non-Functional**

- [ ] **Performance Testing**
  - *Details:* N/A for this STP. No CNV performance code changes; GPU performance is hardware-defined.

- [ ] **Scale Testing**
  - *Details:* N/A. Two-VM concurrent sharing is functional coverage only; no dedicated
    scale testing.

- [ ] **Security Testing**
  - *Details:* Out of scope for dedicated security scenarios. Isolation is enforced by
    NVIDIA GPU firmware / SR-IOV and device exposure is provided by the NVIDIA GPU
    Operator; OpenShift Virtualization adds no isolation mechanism. QE validates VM
    consumption of advertised SR-IOV vGPU devices only.

- [x] **Usability Testing** — Validates user experience for operational feedback
  - *Details:* Validate that the event or message shown when a VM cannot be scheduled
    identifies exhausted VF capacity as the specific cause (not a generic
    scheduling-failure message).

- [ ] **Monitoring**
  - *Details:* N/A. SR-IOV GPU performance monitoring is N/A; no new CNV metrics
    or alerts are required for this cycle.

**Integration & Compatibility**

- [x] **Compatibility Testing**
  - *Details:* Validate on OCP + OpenShift Virtualization 5.0.z,
     NVIDIA GPU Operator (SR-IOV vGPU-capable build).

- [ ] **Upgrade Testing**
  - *Details:* Upgrade path was evaluated. Whether a VM with an SR-IOV vGPU survives
    an OCP upgrade and the guest still detects the GPU afterward is deferred to the
    GA validation STP (see Out of Scope).

- [x] **Dependencies** — Blocked by deliverables from other components/products
  - *Details:* Blocked on NVIDIA GPU Operator SR-IOV vGPU support (version 26.11,
    GA target: Nov 2026).

- [ ] **Cross Integrations**
  - *Details:* N/A for additional SIG-owned feature testing this cycle.

**Infrastructure**

- [ ] **Cloud Testing**
  - *Details:* N/A. Feature requires bare-metal nodes with NVIDIA SR-IOV-capable GPUs.
    No dedicated cloud scenarios.

#### **3. Test Environment**

- **Cluster Topology:** Two topologies are required: (1) 3-control-plane / 3 worker
  nodes bare-metal, RHCOS10-only, with at least one worker node that has an NVIDIA
  SR-IOV-capable GPU, for the core SR-IOV vGPU scenarios; and (2) 3-control-plane /
  3 worker nodes bare-metal, mixed RHCOS9/RHCOS10, with at least one RHCOS10 worker
  node that has an NVIDIA SR-IOV-capable GPU and at least one RHCOS9 worker node with
  an NVIDIA mdev-capable GPU, for the mixed-cluster scenario only

- **OCP & OpenShift Virtualization Version(s):** OCP 5.0.z with OpenShift Virtualization 5.0.z

- **CPU Virtualization:** VT-x (Intel) or AMD-V enabled

- **Compute Resources:** GPU nodes must have NVIDIA SR-IOV-capable GPU

- **Special Hardware:** NVIDIA SR-IOV-capable GPU (e.g., Ampere)

- **Storage:** Any block-mode RWO storage class suitable for VMs (tests are GPU-
  focused; not ODF-specific). example:
  `ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd-virtualization`

- **Network:** OVN-Kubernetes, IPv4

- **Required Operators:** NVIDIA GPU Operator version 26.11 (GA target: Nov 2026)
  with SR-IOV vGPU support, OpenShift Virtualization

- **Platform:** Bare metal

- **Special Configurations:** SR-IOV GPU VFs configured and advertised
  for VM workloads prior to test execution

#### **3.1. Testing Tools & Frameworks**

- **Test Framework:** OpenShift-virtualization-tests

- **CI/CD:** N/A

- **Other Tools:** N/A

#### **4. Entry Criteria**

The following conditions must be met before testing can begin:

- [ ] Requirements and design documents are **approved and merged**
- [ ] Section III test cases/scenarios are **reviewed and approved**
- [ ] Test environment can be **set up and configured** (see Section II.3 - Test Environment)
- [ ] RHCOS10 worker node with NVIDIA SR-IOV-capable GPU is available
- [ ] NVIDIA GPU Operator version 26.11 (GA target: Nov 2026) with SR-IOV vGPU support

#### **5. Risks**

**Timeline/Schedule**

- **Risk:** NVIDIA GPU Operator SR-IOV vGPU support targets version 26.11
  (GA target: Nov 2026); testing may be delayed if the operator lands late relative
  to the CNV 5.0.z TP window
  - **Mitigation:** QE execution and sign-off require NVIDIA GPU Operator version
    26.11 GA with SR-IOV vGPU support (Entry Criteria). Contingency if operator GA
    slips past the CNV 5.0.z TP window:
    1. Escalate immediately to PM/Dev; TP does **not** ship with QE validation
       complete unless PM explicitly accepts that residual risk.
    2. QE does **not** sign off on Pre-GA / dev operator builds.
    3. No meaningful partial P0 validation without the operator SR-IOV path — VF
       advertisement, VM assignment, and scheduling-feedback scenarios all depend on
       operator-provisioned SR-IOV vGPU devices.
  - *Estimated impact on schedule:* If operator GA slips past the TP window, QE
    completion slips with it; TP proceeds without QE sign-off only under explicit PM
    risk acceptance
  - *Sign-off:* Sudhakar Molli / 2026-09-11

**Test Coverage**

- **Risk:** Coverage limited to Ampere GPU(s) — other SR-IOV-capable GPUs not validated
  - **Mitigation:** Ampere is representative of SR-IOV vGPU functionality; additional
    GPU models can be validated in future cycles when hardware becomes available
  - *Areas with reduced coverage:* SR-IOV-capable GPU models other than Ampere
  - *Sign-off:* Sudhakar Molli / 2026-09-11

**Test Environment**

- **None** — cluster availability risk is tracked once, under Resource Constraints.

**Untestable Aspects**

- **Risk:** Until NVIDIA GPU Operator SR-IOV vGPU support is available, end-to-end
  VM assignment cannot be validated
  - **Mitigation:** Gate execution on Entry Criteria (operator version 26.11 GA); do not claim
    QE complete without P0 scenarios passing
  - *Reason untestable and mitigation approach:* Blocked on NVIDIA GPU Operator version
    26.11 GA; testing starts after Entry Criteria are met
  - *Sign-off:* Sudhakar Molli / 2026-09-11

**Resource Constraints**

- **Risk:** Limited availability of the required RHCOS10 Ampere GPU bare-metal cluster,
  and of a mixed cluster with an additional RHCOS9 mdev-capable GPU node for the
  dual-stream scenario, may delay SR-IOV vGPU testing
  - **Mitigation:** Coordinate with the team to schedule access; run P0 first when the
    cluster is available; keep automation ready so execution is not delayed once access
    is granted
  - *Missing resources or infrastructure:* Always-available RHCOS10 Ampere SR-IOV vGPU
    BM cluster, plus a mixed-cluster RHCOS9 mdev-capable GPU node
  - *Sign-off:* Sudhakar Molli / 2026-09-11

**Dependencies**

- **Risk:** Hard dependency on NVIDIA GPU Operator version 26.11 (GA target: Nov 2026)
  with SR-IOV vGPU support
  - **Mitigation:** Track operator version 26.11 GA; keep Dev/PM informed if dependency
    slips. If GA slips past the CNV 5.0.z TP window, follow the Timeline/Schedule
    contingency (no QE sign-off on pre-GA; TP without QE complete only with explicit PM
    risk acceptance)
  - *Third-party services or blockers:* NVIDIA GPU Operator SR-IOV vGPU
  - *Sign-off:* Sudhakar Molli / 2026-09-11
